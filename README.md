Pig Latin in Swift
==================

Here's a quick and very ugly implementation of the classic Pig Latin string manipulation/TDD exercise in everybody's new favourite  programming language, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). Written with Xcode 6 beta 2, only tested on OS 10.10, use at your own risk, etc.

Setup
-----

Just clone this repository and open it with Xcode 6 or later.

Testing
-------

Run the tests with **&#8984;U**; they should all pass. Or at any rate, it works on my machine&trade;:

Running the Sample UI
---------------------

Currently completely broken until Apple fixes [this compiler bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24154163/xcode-swift-failed-with-exit-code-254).
